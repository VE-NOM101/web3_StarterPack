# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

# Usages:
1. In the first part, Vue js and wallet interactions are shown
2. In the final part, Vue js, smart contract interaction and wallet interaction for transaction

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js

commands:
  ->To run node: npx hardhat node
  ->To deploy smart contract: npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js
  ->To run frontend: npm run dev
```
